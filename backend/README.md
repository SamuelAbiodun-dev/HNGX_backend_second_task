## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for code development.
- Maven installed to manage dependencies and build the project.
- Git for cloning the repository.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

Open the project in your Java IDE.
Running the API
Build the project using Maven.
Run the application.
The API should now be running locally at http://localhost:8080.

Configuring the Database
To configure the database, create an application.properties file in the src/main/resources directory. Add the necessary properties to connect to your database. For example:

# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Hibernate properties
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Replace your_database, your_username, and your_password with your database details.

API Endpoints

GET /api/persons: Retrieve a list of all persons.
GET /api/persons/{id}: Retrieve a specific person by their ID.
POST /api/persons: Create a new person.
PATCH /api/persons/{id}: Update a person using JSON Patch.
